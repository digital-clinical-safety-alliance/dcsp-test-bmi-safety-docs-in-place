# Introduction

### This spreadsheet records compliance of a project with the requirements of DCB 0129 "Clinical Risk Management: its Application in the Manufacture of Health IT Systems Version 4"
[readonly]
The text shown in italics in the column Evidence shall be replaced with relevant statements by the user.
In completing the spreadsheet the user is directed towards the Implementation Guidance for the standard as to what evidence is required to show compliance. In the majority of cases, the user shall provide clear references to documents or repositories that contain such evidence. 
The spreadsheet does allow a review to be conducted part way through a particular development with the provision of the [Awaiting] assignment, see below, though it is expected that a reasonable number of the expected clinical risk management activities have been completed before an assessment is made. 
Within this spreadsheet a distinction has been drawn between Mgt System evidence and Project specific evidence. For manufacturers wishing to simply demonstrate an established clinical risk management process only the requirements identified as Mgt System need be populated. However, compliance with DCB 0129 cannot be claimed based on this limited assessment.
In accordance with requirement 3.1.3, this spreadsheet shall be retained in the Clinical Risk Management File.

The Specification requirements use either MUST or SHOULD , where:
• MUST: “means that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification”
• SHOULD: “means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course”.
In order to claim conformance with this Specification, a Manufacturer MUST implement the clinical risk analysis activities defined in sections 2 to 7, within the bounds of the definitions above.

### Under the compliance heading there are five possible entries, though not all five options may be available for a requirement. It is important suitable evidence is provided for all entries except [No].
[readonly]
**Yes** - Evidence has been referenced which clearly demonstrates that the organisation is compliant with this requirement. 

**No** - The organisation is known not to be compliant or no evidence can be referenced which clearly demonstrates compliance with this requirement.

**Not applicable** - For this particular project, the requirement is not applicable. For example, the risk analysis has identified that all risk are acceptable therefore no risk control measures are required. A statement as why the requirement is not applicable shall be provided in the evidence column.
This entry shall also be used when a SHOULD requirement has been intentionally omitted. In this case the evidence column shall provide a rationale as to why it was deemed appropriate to omit this requirement or provide a reference to supporting evidence. Where no evidence can be presented, then [No] must be selected instead.

**Partial** - This requirement covers a number of lifecycle phases and the review is being carried out before completion of the project, for example a staged Clinical Safety Case Report. This assignment can only be used where the requirements has been fulfilled and suitable evidence identified for the completed phase(s) but further work is still to be undertaken to fully meet the requirement.  If the requirement has not been fulfilled for a completed lifecycle phase then [No] must be selected instead. 
Where this compliance statement is to be supplied to a Health Organisation, or NHS England, to support the release of a Health IT System then a further review should be undertaken by the Manufacturer to re-assign this mark to [Yes] and [No] as far as is practicable.

**Awaiting** - The requirement is lifecycle dependent and the review is being carried out before this requirements would normally be undertaken. For example, this assignment may be used for appropriate post-deployment requirements that are indeterminate at the time this review is done.
Where this compliance statement is to be supplied to a Health organisation to support the release of a Health IT System then a further review should be undertaken to re-assign this mark to [Yes] and [No] as far as is practicable.
