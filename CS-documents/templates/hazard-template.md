### Hazard name
A short name

### General Utility label
[multiselect]
1 - Hazard: A hazard which is logged
2 - New hazard for triage: A new hazard which needs to be triaged for severity and likelihood, scored and assigned
3 - Deprecated hazard: A hazard which is no longer considered relevant

### Likelihood scoring
[select] [L]
1 - Very low: Negligible or nearly negligible possibility of occurring
2 - Low: Could occur but in the great majority of occasions will not
3 - Medium: Possible
4 - High: Not certain but very possible; reasonably expected to occur in the majority of cases
5 - Very high: Certain or almost certain; highly likely to occur
    
### Severity scoring
[select] [S]
1 - Minor: Minor injury, short term recovery; minor psychological upset; inconvenience; negligible consequence
2 - Significant: Minor injury, long term, 1; Significant psych. trauma, 1; Minor inj/psych trauma, 2+
3 - Considerable: Severe injury, 1, severe incapacity, recovery expected; Significant psych. trauma, 2+
4 - Major: Death, 1; Severe injury or life-changing incapacity, 1; Psychological trauma, 2+
5 - Catastrophic: Death, 2+. Severe injury or lifechanging incapacity, 2+

### Risk scoring
[calculate] [L] [S]
1 - Acceptable: Acceptable, no further action required [L1-S1, L1-S2, L2-S1]
2 - Acceptable: Acceptable if cost of further reduction > benefits, or further risk reduction is impractical [L1-S3, L1-S4, L2-S2, L2-S3, L3-S1, L3-S2, L4-S1]
3 - Undesirable: Undesirable level of risk. Attempts should be made to eliminate the hazard or implement controls [L1-S5, L2-S4, L3-S3, L3-S4, L4-S2, L4-S3, L5-S1]
4 - Mandatory-risk-elimination: Mandatory elimination of hazard or addition of controls to reduce risk to an acceptable level [L2-S5, L3-S5, L4-S4, L5-S2, L5-S3]
5 - Unacceptable: Unacceptable level of risk [L4-S5, L5-S4, L5-S5]

### Description
A general description of the Hazard. Keep it short. Detail goes below.

### Cause(s)
The upstream system Cause (can be multiple - use a numbered list) that results in the change to intended care.

### Effect
The change in the intended care pathway resulting from the Cause.

### Hazard
The *potential* for Harm to occur, even if it does not.

### Harm
An actual occurrence of a Hazard in the patient or clinical context. This is what we are assessing the **Severity** and **Likelihood** of. This is form normal working conditions and fault conditions. Include the ultimate **Risk rating** as well.

### Existing controls
List any pre-existing controls that can mitigate the hazard.

-----

### Assignment
Assign this Hazard to its Owner. Default owner is the Clinical Safety Officer

### Labelling
Add labels according to Severity. Likelihood and Risk Level

### Project
Add to the Project 'Clinical Risk Management'

* Subsequent discussion can be used to mitigate the Hazard, reducing the likelihood (or less commonly reducing the severity) of the Harm.
* If Harm is reduced then you can change the labels to reflect this and reclassify the Risk Score.
* Issues can be linked to: Issues describing specific software changes, Pull Requests or Commits fixing Issues, external links, and much more supporting documentation. Aim for a comprehensive, well-evidenced, public and open discussion on risk and safety.

### New hazard controls
List controls that will be put into place to mitigate the hazard. These can include design, (unit/integration) testing, training or business process change.

### Residual Hazard Risk Assessment
Include a repeat analysis of **Severity** and **Likelihood**. Include the ultimate **Risk rating** as well.

### Hazard Status
Either 'open', 'transferred' or 'closed'.

### Residual Hazard Risk Assessment
BLAH
