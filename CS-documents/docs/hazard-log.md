# {{ project_name }} Hazard Log

In keeping with our commitment to transparency and openness, our Hazard Log is publicly visible and managed in GitHub using the Issues feature.

Each Issue represents a Hazard potentially affecting the project.

Hazards can be viewed (and indeed commented on, discussed, and improved) at the URL below:

[Hazard summary](hazards/hazards-summary.html)

Instead of the more usual and somewhat outdated and chaotic 'spreadsheet' model, often used for Hazard Logs, we are using individual markdown files for each hazard, and then summarised in the view above.

- _Labels_ are used to annotate Hazard Issues with `severity-` and `likelihood-` scores, from which we can derive a `risk-level-`. See all Labels TODO NEED LABEL PAGE

- _Milestones_ are used to designate the Initial Risk Assessment and Residual Risk Assessment. See all Milestones TODO NEED TO CLARIFY WHAT MILESTONES ARE AND PROVIDE A PAGE FOR THIS IF NEEDED

Most importantly, the **discussion and evidence** relating to any given risk is included in the recording of the risk. A complete history of the labelling is kept in the issue. Spreadsheet-based risk and hazard handling is inferior to this model, because spreadsheets are unsuited to discussion, text handling, and long-form discourse.

> A Hazard which is _never_ recorded in any Spreadsheet-based Hazard Log is 'Accidental deletion of a Hazard before it has been mitigated/risk-eliminated', yet anyone who has used a spreadsheet knows how easy it is to accidentally delete or modify a cell or row inadvertently.
> Put simply, a spreadsheet is a poor choice of technology for managing text and a totally unacceptable choice of technology for handling Hazards, yet it has become the industry standard across the NHS simply because the Hazard Log template issued by NHS Digital is a spreadsheet. Building and releasing an open source, free **Hazard Log management platform** would have been much a better approach, which NHS DIgital had ans still has the resources to do, but lack of understanding about the case of need limits their capability to execute on this.

## Monitoring of Risk

Using the Label search feature, one can search for Hazards at any Risk Level, in order to triage the most risky Hazards for further action.

risk-level-5-unacceptable 
risk-level-4-mandatory-risk-elimination
risk-level-3-undesirable
risk-level-2-acceptable
risk-level-1-acceptable

- We can filter for multiple labels.

## Hazard Deletion

Hazards are **never** deleted but may be _closed_ if there is no residual hazard and they are no longer relevant.
